# PRE-ALPHA EXPERIMENTAL
## Xol Carriage
A new carriage built to allow Xol to standardise around the Voron CW2 (TAP) mounting pattern.
This is in very early stages of development. Parts are subject to change at any time.
Testing and feedback are welcome at the Xol-Toolhead channel on the Armchair Engineering discord. <https://discord.com/channels/1029426383614648421/1046422202460930129>

### Design Goals
* Uses same mounting pattern as TAP (reduce Xol permutations)
* Easily remove toolhead from carriage without toolhead dissassembly
* Modular approach to probes

### Additional Hardware
To accomodate design requirements, some additional hardware will be required when using this mount.
Specifically, M2.5 heatsets are used in the feet of the Xol hotend mount.

The dimentions of the heatests are
* thread: M2.5
* Lenght: 4mm
* Outer Diameter: 3.5mm
(M2.5x4x3.5)

### Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Armchair Engineering team and Voron Design. This carriage is built for Xol but is based heavily on the Voron Design CW2 mounting system.
